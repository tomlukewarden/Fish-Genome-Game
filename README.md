# Educational Fish Genome Game

The plan for this project is to create an educational game using common genome pairings and mutations in puzzles and quizzes etc.

## Key Concepts

- Players assemble DNA sequences of fictional deep-sea fish to unlock traits, such as bioluminescence, extended lifespan, or unique hunting mechanisms.
- Introduce challenges like genetic mutations, sequence alignment puzzles, and editing to modify or repair traits.

### Key Features

**DNA Assembly Puzzle**
Provide scrambled nucleotide sequences and ask players to assemble them correctly to form genes.
Include hints, such as base-pair rules or partial alignment.

**Trait Unlocking**
Once a gene is assembled, reveal traits (e.g., glowing fins, enhanced speed) with educational snippets about real-life equivalents in marine biology.

**Mutation Challenges**
Introduce random mutations where players must spot and fix errors in the sequence to restore function.
Optionally add a feature for adaptive mutations that provide beneficial traits.

**Level Progression**
Start with simple genomes and progressively introduce complexity.
Add environmental challenges, like adapting fish traits to deep-sea pressure or low oxygen levels.

#### Plan

- Make basic Q&A game showing level status
- Introduce more real game items (pygame)
- Create login/profile pages etc
- Decide on sprites and music
